	Please note that there is no code here to update drop-down boxes because the rop-down boxes in the spell selection dialogues are generated automatically and will include any spells you add correctly

	If you are looking for a way to add a cantrip/spell to the drop-down boxes in the attack sections, then you will have to look at the WeaponsList syntax and add the cantrip/spell as a weapon (as well)
