Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the spell's area for the first time on turn or starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can't discern lies from truth while in the radius, as with making a Wisdom (Insight) check or another way. A creature that fails the save and that can automatically discern lies such as one with the Divine Awareness trait, can't automatically discern them, but can make Wisdom (Insight) checks to determine truth as normal.\n  You know whether each creature succeeds or fails on its saving throw. However, creatures affected by this spell don't know if they are or not. Any Wisdom (Insight) checks they make to determine truth are inconclusive.

It likely takes the statistics, abilities, actions, and so on of the solar (Monster Manual 18) but the DM can rule it to use the statistics of another creature (though it should not have a significantly higher or lower CR than the solar). It acts on your turn in combat. A lesser deity or great celestial has no binding to you or requirement to behave as you wish. You can ask the creature as part of casting the spell what you wish for it to do. The creature can't exact payment or trade for its servicesâ€”it will attempt to fulfill your prayer if it is in accordance with its ideals or not contrary.\n  If your prayer is contrary to its nature, or once your prayer is fulfilled or you lose concentration, the creature returns to its previous location, leaving a thin glowing halo on the ground where it disappeared, which can't be dispelled and fades after seven days."
